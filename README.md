### Colour Scheme (explain your colors, etc.... perhaps use coolors.co?)
-Used Coolors.co to get exact colors, Bluue matches viemo color scheme as well as thumbnail of trailer for clients graduate film, the capstone project of their degree and their most accomplished piece of work. 
Black suits minimalism of site, and places all emphasis on the content ie videos and images, which are doing the "talking" for this portfolio, creating a cinematic feel, and bringing out details of darker video thumbnails like SOS, rocking boat, and the showreel itself. Having a full black background also means that the  "black bars" that appear throughout showreel when it switches aspect ratio are less distracting to the viewer. These black bars are present in the thumnnail of the showreel, making the transition from background to video player seamless, again enhancing the "cinematic" qfeel of the site.   
With a black background, it was necessary to choose a a relatiely bright text color to achieve sufficient contrast for easy legibility. To avoid drawing too much attention from the content of the site, this choice was limited to the white/gray spectrum, using no other tones.
Flame was chosen for the gallery transition color using coolor. Searched for a red/orange shade that would compliment the colors already chosen, that would also match the 
### Typography (explain any fonts and icon libraries used, font-awesome/google fonts, etc)

icons chosen for consistent shape, rounded square.
Font chosen alongside colors, thicker fonts create increase legibility which allows for a large range of colors to read as legible on screen. This factor needed to be balanced alongside the clients request for a thin, minimal, elgant font, with as dark a text color as can be acheived without sacrificing legibility.
### Wireframes (include screenshots of your wireframes)
Wireframing the "photos" page raised an interesting design challenge. The photos provided by the client were all associated with a film from the "projects" page. While this represented an opportunity to link each photo to the corresponding video, the fact that each photo came from a differnet shoot meant that they varied in size and shape. It made sense to group the photos together by film, and so the new question was how can we maintain consistentcy in teh design with images that vary in aspect ratio? The client requested that the images not be cropped to create a uniform aspect ratio  as the prupose of the gallery is to promote the clients filmmaking skills, and cropping the images would affect the way the viewer percieves the cinematographical "framing" of the image.
