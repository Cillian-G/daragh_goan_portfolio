![am i responsive screenshot](/assets/documentation/testing/amiresponsive.png)

This site will serve as an online portfolio for filmmaker Daragh Goan. It is designed to showcase his work to potential employers. It's secondary purpose is to encourage these employers to contact Daragh, as well as to continue exploring his work through linked social media profiles and video-sharing platforms.

## User Stories

As a user:
- I want to see images and videos of Daraghs work.
- I want to be able to find links to Daraghs social media pages.
- I want to be able to find Daraghs contact details. 
- I want to find out more about Daragh.

## UX 

- The aim of the design was to do as much as possible to emphasize Daraghs work. For this reason, the design strives to be cinematic wherever it can be, by filling the screen with images where possible, as well as through use of a black background and a text colour that offeres minimal distraction from the content.

### Colour Scheme 

![Coolors.co screnshot](/assets/documentation/testing/coolors.png)

- Black suits the minimalist style of site, and places emphasis on the videos and images which are doing the "talking" for this portfolio. Black creates a cinematic feel, and brings out details of darker video thumbnails like those for "S.O.S.", "Rocking Boat", and the showreel itself. Having a full black background also means that the  "black bars" that appear throughout showreel when it switches aspect ratio are less distracting to the viewer. These black bars are present in the thumnnail of the showreel, making the transition from background to video player seamless, again enhancing the cinematic feel of the site.   
- "Artichoke grey" (#89937C) was chosen to avoid detracting from the site's cinematic focus on portfolio content, while allowing for easy legibility.
- The blue used in the site ("cyan process" #19B7EA) matches the Vimeo color scheme as well as thumbnail of trailer for clients graduate film, the capstone project of their degree and their most accomplished piece of work. Through out the site, a blue hover effect is used to signify interactivity, a fact that is established immediately when the vimeo player loads on the home/about page

### Typography 

- Icons were chosen from a selection on fontawesome.com for their consistent 'rounded square' shape, which matched the font being used for headings.
- Unica One was chosen as the "heading" font with the aim of increasing the legibility of the relatively dark text color against the black background of the site, which was a conscious design choice.  This was based on the clients request for a minimal, elgant font, with as dark a text color as can be acheived without sacrificing legibility.
- Vollkorn was chosen as the main text font at the suggestion of this website https://www.reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/#popup-fonts, which offers a range of font pairings tht work well together.

## Features

### Existing Features

![navbar](/assets/documentation/testing/navbar.png)

#### Navbar

- The page title is naturally the clients name, with the subtitle of "filmmaker". The title also links back to the "about page" where Daraghs showreel and personal information are on display.
- The icons present in the top right of the page are esigned to serve as quick links to give immeidate access to those who want to see more of Daraghs work. There is a link to Daraghs Vimeo, his IMDB page, his Instagram and his twitter, which combine to create a larger portfolio for those who want to see more
- The navbar menu headings are placed in order of importance. The "projects" page is listed first, to allow those who were impressed by Daraghs showreel to see more of his work immediately. The photos page is listed next, and finally contact details are listed last. To ensure easy navigation, a blue bottom border appears under the menu lisitng of the current page.

![showreel](/assets/documentation/testing/showreel.png)

#### Showreel

- The showreel is the most important part of the site, which is why the user is immediately presented with it upon loading the page. The user is encouraged to watch it before exploring the site any further, as its purpose is to give a positive impression of the clients work.

![bio and headshot](/assets/documentation/testing/bio.png)

#### Bio + Headshot

- The brief biography on the page server to make the portfolio site more "personal" and to give potential employer the most important facts about his career.
- The headshot serves to make Daragh seem approachable and easy to work with. 

#### Footer

- The icons in the footer offer the same links as the icons in the navbar, as reminders for any visitors to the site that hvae scrolled all the way to the bottom that these links are available. This is particularly on the longer pages like the Photos or Projects pages, where scrolling the whole way back up would take some time, which might discourage users from exploring further.

![videos page](/assets/documentation/testing/videos.png)

#### Videos page

- The videos page serves to offer more access to Daraghs short films and music videos in the "cinematic" setting of the portfolio site, as opposed to merely linking to a vimeo page. The videos are ordered by type for easy navigation, those more interested in seeing Daraghs short films can scroll until the encounter the next heading they are looking for.
- The hero image on this page is designed to give an impression of continuity with the showreel on the "About" page, and to maintain the cinematic theme of the site.   

![gallery page](/assets/documentation/testing/gallery.png)

#### gallery page

- The gallery page showcases the diversity of Daraghs work by placing a selection of images from his productions beside on another. Through a quick scroll, visitors who didnt watch the showreel, or who perhaps skipped watching videos onthe project page, are given an impression of the diversity of Daraghs work, and are encouraged to explore it further
- This exploration is encoruaged with headings which name which piece of work the image is from, that also serve as links to their correpsonding videos on the projects page.

![contact page](/assets/documentation/testing/contact.png)

#### contact page

- The contact page hero-image is desinged to sustain the sense of continuity created the by similar placement of the showreel and project page hero images. Furthermore, the image on this page suits the theme of communication, and was chosen to elicit good humour from visitors.
- Daraghs contact details are listed plainly and clearly, and links to his social media pages behave like all links on the site by turning blue when hovered over, further encouraging users to explore hsi work further.

### Features Left to Implement

- Future developments in Daraghs career will need to be refelcted in the site, which may involve swapping out his showreel for a new one, adding further videos and images to the projects and photos pages, as well as adding details of agencies or managers to the contact page.
