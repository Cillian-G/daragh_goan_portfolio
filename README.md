etc etc

## UX (briefly explain your design)

-mention weight of icons, order of icons in top right corner, how to avoid confusion with navbar tabs,
-aim for cinematic feel, minimal distraction from content, while ensuring navigation to further content and contact details is intuitive and simple 

### Colour Scheme (explain your colors, etc.... perhaps use coolors.co?) 

Black suits the minimalist style of site, and places emphasis on the videos and images which are doing the "talking" for this portfolio. Black creates a cinematic feel, and brings out details of darker video thumbnails like those for "S.O.S.", "Rocking Boat", and the showreel itself. Having a full black background also means that the  "black bars" that appear throughout showreel when it switches aspect ratio are less distracting to the viewer. These black bars are present in the thumnnail of the showreel, making the transition from background to video player seamless, again enhancing the cinematic feel of the site.   
"Artichoke grey" (#89937C) was chosen to avoid detracting from the site's cinematic focus on portfolio content, while allowing for easy legibility. Other tones were avoided so as to 
The blue used in the site (cyan process #19B7EA) matches the Vimeo color scheme as well as thumbnail of trailer for clients graduate film, the capstone project of their degree and their most accomplished piece of work.

### Typography (explain any fonts and icon libraries used, font-awesome/google fonts, etc)

-fonts and icons.
icons chosen for consistent shape, rounded square.
Font chosen alongside colors, thicker fonts create increase legibility which allows for a large range of colors to read as legible on screen. This factor needed to be balanced alongside the clients request for a thin, minimal, elgant font, with as dark a text color as can be acheived without sacrificing legibility.

### Wireframes (include screenshots of your wireframes)

Wireframing the "photos" page raised an interesting design challenge. The photos provided by the client were all associated with a film from the "projects" page. While this represented an opportunity to link each photo to the corresponding video, the fact that each photo came from a differnet shoot meant that they varied in size and shape. It made sense to group the photos together by film, and so the new question was how can we maintain consistentcy in teh design with images that vary in aspect ratio? The client requested that the images not be cropped to create a uniform aspect ratio  as the prupose of the gallery is to promote the clients filmmaking skills, and cropping the images would affect the way the viewer percieves the cinematographical "framing" of the image.
