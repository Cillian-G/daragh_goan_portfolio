Wireframing the "photos" page raised an interesting design challenge. The photos provided by the client were all associated with a film from the "projects" page. While this represented an opportunity to link each photo to the corresponding video, the fact that each photo came from a differnet shoot meant that they varied in size and shape. It made sense to group the photos together by film, and so the new question was how can we maintain consistentcy in teh design with images that vary in aspect ratio? The client requested that the images not be cropped to create a uniform aspect ratio  as the prupose of the gallery is to promote the clients filmmaking skills, and cropping the images would affect the way the viewer percieves the cinematographical "framing" of the image.
